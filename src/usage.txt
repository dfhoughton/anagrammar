This utility allows you to generate all the anagrams of a phrase that obey a particular
grammar. In order to do this it needs a grammar and word lists that define the acceptable
values of terminal nodes in the grammar. For instance, you might have the grammar

  name -> <first>
  name -> <last>
  name -> <first> <last>

This grammar says a name can be a "first" by itself, a "last" by itself, or a "first"
followed by a "last". Just what these things are must be specified by two word lists:
first and last. To use this grammar, you must configure this application to find
the grammar and the word lists. Run the --initialize command if you have not already and
then edit the configuration file it generates to tell anagrammar where to find the
grammar file and the word lists it requires. A specification of the grammar formalism
can be found in the README file in the same directory as the configuration file.
